BBB [dot] JS
A library that works with the HTML5 <video> tag.

VERSION 0.1
The first release of BBB.js includes functionality for creating video chapters. A chapter is 
defined as having a title, source URL, start time, and end time. BBB.js also includes functionality
that dynamically populates a "table of contents" when a new chapter is created. This table of contents
will include a URL for the chapter title. If clicked the selected chapter will play from start to end time. 
A "Play All" URL will also be generated. If clicked all chapters will play in sequential order. (Order as they were added)
BBB.js also includes functions to serialize a Bookmark object to JSON, and convert JSON back into a Bookmark object.

COMPATIBILITY
Browsers that support the HTML5 <video> tag
